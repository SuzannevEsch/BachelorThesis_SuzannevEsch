SOLNAM = 'Vredepeel'

**Soil water retention
SM0    =  0.45 !Soil porosity [cm3/cm3]     based on local pF curve
SMFCF  =  0.24 !Soil moisture content at field capacity [cm3/cm3] based on local pF curve
SMW    =  0.04 ! Soil moisture content at wilting point [cm3/cm3]  based on local pF curve 
CRAIRC =  0.01 ! Critical soil air content for aeration [cm3/cm3]


**Hydraulic conductivity
K0     = 10.0  ! Hydraulic conductivity of saturated soil [cm day-1]
KSUB   = 10.0  ! Maximum percolation rate subsoil [cm day-1]         
SOPE   = 10.0  ! Maximum percolation rate root zone[cm day-1]       
RDMSOL = 60.0  ! Maximum rootable depth of the soil [cm]
